Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number.

The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

@dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in\n https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].\n Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by\n presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n ==== Security Considerations\n There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n generally recommended is:\n ```solidity\n function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n     doThing(..., value);\n }\n function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit."},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":1113,"linearizedBaseContracts":[1113],"name":"IERC20Permit","nameLocation":"2123:12:8","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"documentation":{"id":1081,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"2142:850:8","text":" @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n ordering also apply here.\n Emits an {Approval} event.\n Requirements:\n -

While a change from nonzero to zero DOES guarantee that a validator\n has been fully exited, it is possible that the magnitude of this change does not capture what is\n typically thought of as a \"full exit.\"\n For example:\n 1. Consider a validator was last checkpointed at 32 ETH before exiting. Once the exit has been processed,\n it is expected that the validator's exited balance is calculated to be `32 ETH`.\n 2. However, before `startCheckpoint` is called, a deposit is made to the validator for 1 ETH. The beacon\n chain will automatically withdraw this ETH, but not until the withdrawal sweep passes over the validator\n again. Until this occurs, the validator's current balance (used for checkpointing) is 1 ETH.\n 3. If `startCheckpoint` is called at this point, the balance delta calculated for this validator will be\n `-31 ETH`, and because the validator has a nonzero balance, it is not marked WITHDRAWN.\n 4. After the exit is processed by the beacon chain, a subsequent `startCheckpoint` and checkpoint proof\n will calculate a balance delta of `-1 ETH` and attribute a 1 ETH exit to the validator.\n If this edge case impacts your usecase, it should be possible to mitigate this by monitoring for deposits\n to your exited validators, and waiting to call `startCheckpoint` until those deposits have been automatically\n exited.\n Additional edge cases this mapping does not cover:\n - If a validator is slashed, their balance exited will reflect their original balance rather than the slashed amount\n - The final partial withdrawal for an exited validator will be likely be included in this mapping.\n   i.e. if a validator was last checkpointed at 32.1 ETH before exiting, the next checkpoint will calculate their\n   \"exited\" amount to be 32.1 ETH rather than 32 ETH."},"functionSelector":"52396a59","id":6457,"implemented":false,"kind":"function","modifiers":[],"name":"checkpointBalanceExitedGwei","nameLocation":"15646:27:22","nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","parameters":{"id":6453,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":6452,"mutability":"mutable","name":"","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6457,"src":"15674:6:22","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint64","typeString":"uint64"},"typeName":{"id":6451,"name":"uint64","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"15674:6:22","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint64","typeString":"uint64"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"15673:8:22"},"returnParameters":{"id":6456,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":6455,"mutability":"mutable","name":"","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":6457,"src":"15705:6:22","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint64","typeString":"uint64"},"typeName":{"id":6454,"name":"uint64","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"15705:6:22","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint64","typeString":"uint64"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"15704:8:22"},"scope":6466,"src":"15637:76:22","stateMutability":"view","virtual":false,"visibility":"external"},{"documentation":{"id":6458,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"15719:332:22","text":"@notice Query the 4788 oracle to get the parent block root of the slot with the given `timestamp`\n @param timestamp of the block for which the parent block root will be returned.

@title Adds pausability to a contract, with pausing & unpausing controlled by the `pauser` and `unpauser` of a PauserRegistry contract.\n @author Layr Labs, Inc.\n @notice Terms of Service: https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/terms-of-service\n @notice Contracts that inherit from this contract may define their own `pause` and `unpause` (and/or related) functions.\n These functions should be permissioned as \"onlyPauser\" which defers to a `PauserRegistry` for determining access control.\n @dev Pausability is implemented using a uint256, which allows up to 256 different single bit-flags; each bit can potentially pause different functionality.\n Inspiration for this was taken from the NearBridge design here https://etherscan.io/address/0x3FEFc5A4B1c02f21cBc8D3613643ba0635b9a873#code.\n For the `pause` and `unpause` functions we've implemented, if you pause, you can only flip (any number of) switches to on/1 (aka \"paused\"), and if you unpause,\n you can only flip (any number of) switches to off/0 (aka \"paused\").\n If you want a pauseXYZ function that just flips a single bit / \"pausing flag\", it will:\n 1) 'bit-wise and' (aka `&`) a flag with the current paused state (as a uint256)\n 2) update the paused state to this new value\n @dev We note as well that we have chosen to identify flags by their *bit index* as opposed to their numerical value, so, e.g. defining `DEPOSITS_PAUSED = 3`\n indicates specifically that if the *third bit* of `_paused` is flipped -- i.e. it is a '1' -- then deposits should be paused"},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":6721,"linearizedBaseContracts":[6721],"name":"IPausable","nameLocation":"1671:9:24","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"anonymous":false,"documentation":{"id":6654,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"1687:76:24","text":"@notice

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all. ==== Security Considerations There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be generally recommended is: ```solidity function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}     doThing(..., value); } function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);     ... } ``` Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}). Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()\":{\"details\":\"Returns the domain separator used in the encoding of the signature for {permit}, as defined by {EIP712}.\"},\"nonces(address)\":{\"details\":\"Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

Example usage to set ERC1967 implementation slot: ```solidity contract ERC1967 {     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;     }     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {         require(newImplementation.code.length > 0);         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;     } } ```\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":\"StorageSlot\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x32ba59b4b7299237c8ba56319110989d7978a039faf754793064e967e5894418\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://1ae50c8b562427df610cc4540c9bf104acca7ef8e2dcae567ae7e52272281e9c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmTHiadFCSJUPpRjNegc5SahmeU8bAoY8i9Aq6tVscbcKR\"]}},\"version\":1}","storageLayout":{"storage":[],"types":null}}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol":{"ECDSA":{"abi":[{"inputs":[],"name":"ECDSAInvalidSignature","type":"error"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"length","type":"uint256"}],"name":"ECDSAInvalidSignatureLength","type":"error"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"bytes32","name":"s","type":"bytes32"}],"name":"ECDSAInvalidSignatureS","type":"error"}],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"60808060405234601757603a9081601d823930815050f35b600080fdfe600080fdfea26469706673582212209506e4a60225385ed1d946fdfbaa97945521e37c6720871d6650d7b8c7c39b0d64736f6c63430008180033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x80 DUP1 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE PUSH1 0x17 JUMPI PUSH1 0x3A SWAP1 DUP2 PUSH1 0x1D DUP3 CODECOPY ADDRESS DUP2 POP POP RETURN JUMPDEST PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 SWAP6 MOD 0xE4 0xA6 MUL 0x25 CODESIZE MCOPY 0xD1 0xD9 CHAINID REVERT 0xFB 0xAA SWAP8 SWAP5 SSTORE 0x21 0xE3 PUSH29 0x6720871D6650D7B8C7C39B0D64736F6C63430008180033000000000000 ","sourceMap":"344:7386:12:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"600080fdfea26469706673582212209506e4a60225385ed1d946fdfbaa97945521e37c6720871d6650d7b8c7c39b0d64736f6c63430008180033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 SWAP6 MOD 0xE4 0xA6 MUL 0x25 CODESIZE MCOPY 0xD1 0xD9 CHAINID REVERT 0xFB 0xAA SWAP8 SWAP5 SSTORE 0x21 0xE3 PUSH29 0x6720871D6650D7B8C7C39B0D64736F6C63430008180033000000000000 ","sourceMap":"344:7386:12:-:0;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.24+commit.e11b9ed9\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"ECDSAInvalidSignature\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"length\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}],\"name\":\"ECDSAInvalidSignatureLength\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bytes32\",\"name\":\"s\",\"type\":\"bytes32\"}],\"name\":\"ECDSAInvalidSignatureS\",\"type\":\"error\"}],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) operations.

While a change from nonzero to zero DOES guarantee that a validator has been fully exited, it is possible that the magnitude of this change does not capture what is typically thought of as a \\\"full exit.\\\" For example: 1. Consider a validator was last checkpointed at 32 ETH before exiting. Once the exit has been processed, it is expected that the validator's exited balance is calculated to be `32 ETH`. 2. However, before `startCheckpoint` is called, a deposit is made to the validator for 1 ETH. The beacon chain will automatically withdraw this ETH, but not until the withdrawal sweep passes over the validator again. Until this occurs, the validator's current balance (used for checkpointing) is 1 ETH. 3. If `startCheckpoint` is called at this point, the balance delta calculated for this validator will be `-31 ETH`, and because the validator has a nonzero balance, it is not marked WITHDRAWN. 4. After the exit is processed by the beacon chain, a subsequent `startCheckpoint` and checkpoint proof will calculate a balance delta of `-1 ETH` and attribute a 1 ETH exit to the validator. If this edge case impacts your usecase, it should be possible to mitigate this by monitoring for deposits to your exited validators, and waiting to call `startCheckpoint` until those deposits have been automatically exited. Additional edge cases this mapping does not cover: - If a validator is slashed, their balance exited will reflect their original balance rather than the slashed amount - The final partial withdrawal for an exited validator will be likely be included in this mapping.   i.e. if a validator was last checkpointed at 32.1 ETH before exiting, the next checkpoint will calculate their   \\\"exited\\\" amount to be 32.1 ETH rather than 32 ETH.\"},\"currentCheckpoint()\":{\"notice\":\"Returns the currently-active checkpoint\"},\"currentCheckpointTimestamp()\":{\"notice\":\"The timestamp of the currently-active checkpoint.
